# About the project
<p align="justify">
The goal of the project is the realization of an autonomous vehicle which has the ability to move through the room and map the area around it. Vehicle has a 4 wheel base (2 free wheels and 2 DC motor driven wheels) which are controlled by the control board based on PIC24FJ64GA microcontroller. Space mapping and movement control is done with the help of Lidar. User can control vehicle movement by an user application and it's GUI while monitoring the real-time view of the surrounding area.
